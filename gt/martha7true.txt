1853
Jan 16th Snowed all last night and all day; Still
continues though not so much and it is already melt
ing and falling from the house. About four inches
thick. Been in doors all day with a grumbling tooth,
Husband and I finished Fuller's comments on the
Apocalypse. What bearing is this rebellion to have
upon the religious resting of the empire? The insurgents 
are already within a hundred miles of
Nanking -less than three hundred from here. They
are to attack Nanking about the first of the Chinese
year (8th of Feb) Soldiers have been sent pou
this place - Insurgent army has made its
way through the very heart of the country &
gained some important battles. May all these
wars work for the extension of our master's
kingdom.
Jan 17th More soldiers and officers gone to join the em
perors forces at Nanking. Considerable excitement for Chinese.
The leaders of the rebels are said to be men of wisdom and
energy- the soldiers of activity and training.
Snow still covering the streets and houses so I
did not think it prudent to go with husband to
the society's meeting at Dr. Taylors.C. has his system
characters nicely written out and under other circumstances 
I would hope for its adoption by the committee.
Jan 18th Fresh reports from the rebellion - people are
becoming excited and expecting the people of Nanking
to spread about through the surrounding cities &
of course great numbers flock to this place.
